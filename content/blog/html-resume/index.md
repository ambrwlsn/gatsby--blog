<h2>Who</h2>
<p>I am a web developer with a Master's degree in psychology. I studied psychology because I love learning what makes
people tick and helping them to lead happy lives.</p>
<p>I've always had a huge love for science, and also for design. Growing up, I built websites, was glued to Photoshop,
and made stop-motion animation.</p>
<p>In
<time datetime="2016-06">June 2016</time> I rediscovered web development in <span class="p-locality">Brighton</span>, and was instantly
captivated by the creative community there. In
<time datetime="2018-01">January</time> this year, I moved to <span class="p-locality">Berlin</span> and I'm really excited to continue
building a career doing things I love and working with great people.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>What</h2>
<p>I tend to like working primarily on the frontend and with the UI (especially using HTML and CSS), and I really enjoy
working with JavaScript. I have begun exploring server-side JavaScript in addition to client-side and want to
continue doing this. I enjoy working closely with other developers and designers to find the best solutions.</p>
<p>In my previous job, I worked with JavaScript on the client-side, had an introduction to PHP and templating via Craft
CMS, and learned about continuous integration and testing. In my current job, I've gained a lot of experience
with functional programming in JavaScript, server-side rendering, SCSS, React, Redux, GraphQL, and unit tests.
I have focused on becoming more independent -- knowing when to look for answers, and when to ask for help.
</p>
<p>I enjoy varied tasks and the chance to work with other passionate people. Something very important to me is being
involved in the web development community. I got my entry into web development at
<a href="https://codebar.io">codebar</a> as a student and now help organise it (now in Berlin, previously in
Brighton). I have spoken at five conferences (<a href="https://web.material.is/2017/">Material</a>, <a href="https://nightlybuild.io/">NightlyBuild</a>,
<a href="https://www.bytesconf.co.uk/">Bytes Conf</a>, <a href="https://beyondtellerrand.com/">Beyond Tellerrand</a>,
and
<a href="https://the-intersectional-tech-meetup.glitch.me/">The Intersectional Tech Meetup</a>). I've attended
and volunteered at over 20 conferences and events. I like to write about my experiences on my <a href="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/">blog</a>.</p>
